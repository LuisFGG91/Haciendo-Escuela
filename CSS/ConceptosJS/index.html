            <h1>JavaScript Basics</h1>
            <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. JavaScript is extremely popular for a
                variety of
                reasons. It is a small and
                lightweight language allowing maximum flexibility for developers to take it in a bunch of different
                directions.
                JavaScript lives inside a host
                environment (a web browser or Node server), it can be connected to the objects of these environments to
                provide
                programmatic control over
                them.
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Variable Declaration JavaScript variables are containers for storing data values - imagine a cup you
                    fill with coffee,
                    the cup holds the coffee,
                    a variable holds a value. All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names. These
                    unique names are called
                    identifiers. var X;
                    Variable Assignment Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables - our cup can now
                    have coffee poured in
                    it, giving our
                    variable a value to hold. The = assignment operator assigns a value to a variable. var x = 10;
                    Data Types Data types are an important concept; to be able to operate on variables you need to know
                    the data type. There
                    are six data types
                    that are JavaScript primitives: Boolean - true or false; null - null aka nothing; Number - 42 or
                    3.14159; String - '
                    "Coding Dojo Rocks!";
                    Array - [1, 'Coding', 2, Dojo']; and Object - {first _name: 'Jane', last _name: 'Doe'}
                    Conditionals When you write code, you want to perform different actions for different decisions -
                    hitting different code
                    blocks based on
                    values or conditions that have been met. You can use conditional statements in your code to
                    accomplish this. There are
                    the following
                    conditional statements: if a specified condition is true, do this code in our code block; else if to
                    specify a new
                    condition to test, if the first
                    condition is false; else we execute this block of code;
                    Loops There are many different kinds of loops in every programming language, but they all
                    essentially do the same thing:
                    they will repeat
                    an action some number of times. Imagine you have to run a mile, well you run round the track four
                    times and then you
                    stop. Thats a loop!
                    Function Functions are an encaspulation of a code block. When we call our function this will run
                    that code block. Think
                    of it as a list of
                    instructions. As an example imagine we are putting together a desk from Ikea, we open up the
                    instruction manual and get
                    started, first we
                    screw the legs to the table top; next we place the table the right way up. Done! We finished our
                    instructions. Sadly
                    there are a ton more
                    tables to do so lets call our function over and over and over again.
